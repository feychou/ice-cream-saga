# :ice_cream: ice-cream-saga 

I'm using the same ice-cream app to teach about several React topics to my students and I thought the project needed its own mono-repo

The project is organised in topics and each of them holds two projects, the assignment and the solution.

Current topics:

- [props](https://github.com/feychou/ice-cream-saga/tree/main/props/assignment)
- [context](https://github.com/feychou/ice-cream-saga/tree/main/context/assignment)
- [redux](https://github.com/feychou/ice-cream-saga/tree/main/redux/assignment) - solution still missing here

`Install and run`

Each assignment and solution is runnable by navigating into the project and running 

```
npm i
npm start
```

All of them use port 3000.
Have fun!
